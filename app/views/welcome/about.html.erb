After finishing my studies in computer science sometime soon, I intend to travel around Europe with a backpack and no money other than what I earn on the way. I intend to start out cycling and, after that, to mostly walk and hitchhike.

I will take a small tent and either sleep in the wild or ask people whether I can stay in their garden for a night. When I have no money, I can hopefully get food and water that is left over from supermarkets and/or restaurants, by begging from people at a supermarket, or ideally from finding it in the wild.
I will wash my clothes in lakes or at people's homes if they are willing to help me.

If I like a place (probably mountains or beautiful old cities), I might stay there for a week or two and perhaps find a small job. If possible I would also like to make myself useful to some organization, if that is compatible with my traveling/homeless lifestyle plans.

I am still in doubt concerning electronics; a smartphone and camera would be nice to record and share the journey, but I can also see the merit of being totally unplugged, and not having to worry about them getting wet, breaking, getting stolen or simply the risk of losing them.

Since I have no experience with this, I am quite sure that there are some things I have forgotten about. Perhaps I will quickly change my mind about the journey and go home, but at the moment I expect to be away for several months.

Any experiences/thoughts concerning social interaction, money, food, equipment, sleeping places, physical and emotional survival are most welcome!
